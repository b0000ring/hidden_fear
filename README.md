This is a little rogue-like game written on Lua script with only ncurses extended dependency.
Works in a terminal with kind a simple ASCII graphics style.
To win you must kill all the monsters and from last you get the key for door in house with final boss!
Kill it, but be ready. It's a strange power from deep old times.
Based on 'The Lurking Fear' written by H.P. Lovecraft.
